So due to some halo induced late nights while off work I managed to get myself in to a basically nocturnal sleeping pattern. So this morning after only 3 hours sleep I woke up about 5am. After 2 hours uselessly trying to pass out again I gave up and decided to get up and make myself some food (mmmmm bacon) and tea. It suddenly occurred to me it was still dark outside and not only that but there was something that in over 5 years in Edinburgh I have never done. 

So I pulled on some shoes and a coat, grabbed my camera and headed for Arthur's seat to watch the sun rise. Which I have to say was incredibly pretty and satisfying. Now I know that some of you who know me well know my general apathy in the mornings is a thing of legend. I also know how untrustworthy and cynical some of you are and that those among you would scoff at my tale as nothing more as a made up fantasy, or at best a strange crazed dream. So here is some proof. Just found the web page creation option in aperture which can automagicaly create html source from image selections. Have not put up really high res images yet cause I am having to host this through my old uni cplab account and I have no idea what my quota is on it these days. I am reasonably happy with the pictures but there is still a little camera shake there that takes away from the sharpness of the images, need to invest in a tripod me thinks.

going to upload some of the images from new years soon as well but I am way to shattered just now 

take care all
