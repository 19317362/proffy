Complete race calculation so that one complete race result can be done and
checked.  Depends on:

  Truncate precision on velocities.

  Pigeon times are over the course of more than just 24hrs.

  Clock set and open times need to be second accurate.

Unit test clock correction.

Add fed-version of race result, including section and open.

  Need to take in club and section info for members too.

Add functionality to view/print member/racepoint info.

Need to be able to start a new season bringing over existing member / racepoint info.

For club level:

  Points
  
  Averages
  
  Pools
