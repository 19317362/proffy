Batch build the whole solution.

Find the outer source file which you want to profile and:

  Add #include <C:/path/to/Proffy/Proffy/Launcher.h>

  Decorate the function to be profiled like this (note the {} braces for
  scoping of Proffy::Launcher variable):

    {
        Proffy::Launcher profiler(
            L"C:/path/to/Proffy/Release", // Path to Proffy.exe
            L"C:/path/to/Proffy/Proffy/my_profile_results.xml", // Output filename for this profile run
            1.0 / 20); // Delay between samples, so here set to 20 Hz

        SomeFunctionWhichWillGetProfiled();

        // The Proffy::Launcher destructor will cause the profiler to stop and save
        // the report.  So ensure you have the scope correct.
    }
    exit(0); // Optional statement just to end the program we are profiling


After running the application you can open the
"C:/path/to/Proffy/Proffy/my_profile_results.xml" file in Firefox or IE. It
is important that this file be placed alongside the "Xhtml.xsl" file that
came with Proffy.

Also take care to ensure that frame pointers are present in the application
being profiled. If these are omitted (due to optimization settings) then the
results from the profiler will be extremely poor.
