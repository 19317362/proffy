Find the outer source file which you want to profile and:

  Add #include <C:/path/to/Proffy/Proffy/Launcher.h>

  Decorate the function to be profiled like this (note the {} braces for scoping
  of Proffy::Launcher variable):

    {
        Proffy::Launcher profiler(
            L"C:/path/to/Proffy/bin64/Proffy64.exe", // Path to Proffy.exe
            L"C:/path/to/Proffy", // Output directory for the result files
            1.0 / 20); // Delay between samples, so here set to 20 Hz

        SomeFunctionWhichWillGetProfiled();

        // The Proffy::Launcher destructor will cause the profiler to stop and save
        // the report.  So ensure you have the scope correct.
    }
    exit(0); // Optional statement just to end the program we are profiling


After running the application you can open the XML files in Firefox or Chrome
(Internet Explorer is currently not supported). It is important that a copy of
"Xhtml.xsl" be placed into the same folder.

Also take care to ensure that frame pointers are present in the application
being profiled. If these are omitted (due to optimization settings) then the
results from the profiler will be extremely poor.

Note that the 64-bit version of Proffy (Proffy64.exe) is capable of profiling
both 32-bit and 64-bit targets. The 32-bit version of Proffy (Proffy32.exe) is
only capable of profiling 32-bit targets.
