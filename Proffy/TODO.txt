In rough order of priority, from highest to lowest:

* Fix or forbid profiling of 32-bit targets from 64-bit profiler.

* Brand with a version number & Produce a packaging script.

* Detect when symbols change (target loads or unloads a DLL).

  - Then cache symbol lookups by offset.  Cache gets invalidated when symbols change.

* Remove dead code added during initial exploration of DbgEng.
